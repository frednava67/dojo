        <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.  JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.  It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.  JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.

        <ul>
          <li><a href="nothing.html">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variab les are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.  All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.  These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="coloredtext">var x;</span>
          </li>
          <li><a href="nothing.html">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.  The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="coloredtext">var x = 10;</span>
          </li>       
          <li><a href="nothing.html">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="coloredtext">true</span> or <span class="coloredtext">false;</span> null - <span class="coloredtext">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="coloredtext">42</span> or <span class="coloredtext">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="coloredtext">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="coloredtext">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object = <span class="coloredtext">{first_name: 'Jane',last_name: 'Doc'}/span>
          </li>
          <li><a href="nothing.html">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="coloredtext">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this in our code block; <span class="coloredtext">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="coloredtext">else</span> we execute this block of code;
          </li>             
          <li><a href="nothing.html">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop! 
          </li>
          <li><a href="nothing.html">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
