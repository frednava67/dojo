on github.com i used the UI to create a fork of the repo and located in my github account space.
i think cloned that newly forked repo so that I had it on my laptop locally
i then made a small change to the html file
i added, committed and pushed the change to github
i then went to the pull request tab and created a new pull request for jjun to review/approve
