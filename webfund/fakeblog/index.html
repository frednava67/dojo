                    Mark Watney has a degree in Botany which naturally made him a prime candidate for a mission to Mars.  Little did he know that his Botany degree would play a key role in his survival after being left for dead on the 4th rock from the sun.  A star he lovingly calls, Sol.  Here is a very short summary of his time on Mars.
