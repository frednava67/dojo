Your goal for this assignment is to modify apps/leagues/views.py and/or apps/leagues/templates/leagues/index.html so that instead the page shows:


...all baseball leagues
l = League.objects.all().filter(name__contains="Baseball")

...all womens' leagues
l = League.objects.all().filter(name__contains="Women")

...all leagues where sport is any type of hockey
l = League.objects.all().filter(name__contains="Hockey")

...all leagues where sport is something OTHER THAN football
l = League.objects.all().exclude(name__contains="Football")

...all leagues that call themselves "conferences"
l = League.objects.all().filter(name__contains="Conference")

...all leagues in the Atlantic region
l = League.objects.all().filter(name__contains="Atlantic")

...all teams based in Dallas
Team.objects.all().filter(location__contains="Dallas")

...all teams named the Raptors
Team.objects.all().filter(team_name__contains="Raptors")

...all teams whose location includes "City"
Team.objects.all().filter(location__contains="City")

...all teams whose names begin with "T"
Team.objects.all().filter(team_name__startswith="T")

...all teams, ordered alphabetically by location
Team.objects.all().order_by("location")

...all teams, ordered by team name in reverse alphabetical order
Team.objects.all().order_by("-team_name")

...every player with last name "Cooper"
Player.objects.all().filter(last_name__contains="Cooper")

...every player with first name "Joshua"
Player.objects.all().filter(first_name__contains="Joshua")

...every player with last name "Cooper" EXCEPT those with "Joshua" as the first name
Player.objects.all().filter(last_name__contains="Cooper").exclude(first_name__contains="Joshua").values()

...all players with first name "Alexander" OR first name "Wyatt"
from django.db.models import Q
 Player.objects.all().filter(Q(first_name__contains="Alexander") | Q(first_name__contains="Wyatt"))
